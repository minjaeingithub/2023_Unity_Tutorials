## **🐰 Final Comment**

Done with Week 2! We are under time pressure, so main topics were sorted out, regarding my standards hehe. Sorry. 

I tried to tap into those that could be useful when making psychological experiment.

It's hard to thoroughly understand everything I dealt with today. (If you did, you have FULL potential as a sw developer.) It's tough.

Nevertheless, I'm confident that we are capable of reading others' codes. That's all what we want. See you next week.
