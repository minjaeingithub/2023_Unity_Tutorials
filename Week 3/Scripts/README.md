## **👾 Final Comment**

FINALLY! We've reached to the end of Sharing-Knowledge meeting for Unity. Thanks all for carrying this meeting together. On the bright side, we've made a progress on understaning the Unity and acutally made SUPERFICIAL projects. On much more brighter side, there's much more in Unity! You'll find out when making(debugging) your own game.

Hope you guys had fun. Now, I'll hand over my 🎙 to Jiyeon & Hansol(This is how coroutine works hahahaha). Thanks again.
