# Week 1 Recap üßê
#### Welcome to Sharing-Knowledge Meeting! I hope you and I grasp how Unity works and enjoy the pleasure of making something on my own.
## **‚úèÔ∏è This week, we learned the followings through video:**
- Basic manipulations in editor scene
- Basic C# syntax as well as using `Vector3`, `transform`, `gameObject` and so on.
  It's just like importing libraries from Python. Now, you know what "USING" means on the very first top of the code when script was made!
<br/><br/>
## üíª **Code Explanation**
- Codes along the tutorial videos:
  - FollowPlayer.cs
  - PlayerController.cs
- Codes for the challenge video(Aircraft):
  - FollowPlayerX.cs
  - PlayerControllerX.cs
- Codes for bonus tutorial(Local Multiusers):
  - FollowPlayer1.cs
  - PlayerController1.cs
  - AutoDrive.cs
- My code of using particle systems
  - Target.cs
 
In Unity, you can easily check errors thrown from your computer(e.g. compiled was failed due to errors we've made haha) through the **console** tab.
One of the reasons why errors were thrown is because of typos. So, I uploaded my code for us to double check.

## **ü•≥Final Comment**

As I've said, candid suggestions are welcomed & please brag about what you've made! See you next week.
